# QA Selenium Automation with Python

## Objective
Create a Selenium automation script in Python to validate search functionality on the **Selenium Playground** website.

> [!NOTE]
> **Deliverables:**
> 1. A Python script (`qa_selenium_test.py`) that:
>    - Navigates to the [Selenium Playground Table Search Demo](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-playground/table-sort-search-demo).
>    - Locates and interacts with the search box to search for "New York".
>    - Validates that the search results show **5 entries out of 24 total entries**.
> 2. A brief **README** explaining the approach and how to run the script.
> 3. Any additional setup instructions (e.g., local environment, dependencies, drivers etc).

> [!TIP]
> Use Python's `pytest` framework to structure your test cases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Environment Setup:** Follow good coding practices and ensure the script is compatible with the latest stable Selenium version.
> - **Browser Compatibility:** Test with at least one major browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

> [!CAUTION]
> - **Assertions:** Ensure all validations use robust assertion statements.
> - **Code Quality:** Follow PEP8 standards for Python code.

**Good luck!**
